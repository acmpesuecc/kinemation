Hi, I’m Amrita Pradeep, a Computer Science student passionate about research and technology. I enjoy working on research-oriented projects, particularly in collaborative, team-based environments that encourage critical thinking and innovation.

I enjoy reading, watching films, and writing short stories and poetry. Looking forward to bringing this project to life with the team!
